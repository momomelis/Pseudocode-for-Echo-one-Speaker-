Echo Mirrors

⚡ Interactive Echo Mirror (mock-up pipeline)

1. Input (Person / Transcript Segment)
	•	You select one speaker (or one slice of their transcript).
	•	The app isolates their speech patterns.

2. Echo Fingerprint
	•	Capture their top repeated words/phrases.
	•	Measure similarity between their speech and everyone else in the Space.
	•	Highlight phrases they “borrowed” vs phrases they “originated.”

3. Mirror Reveal
	•	One-button interface → press = reveal.
	•	Two mirrors:
	•	Self mirror: shows the person’s unique words (what only they said).
	•	Echo mirror: shows what they repeated from others (or what others repeated after them).

4. Interactivity
	•	Button press could trigger:
	•	A word cloud morphing animation (unique → echoed).
	•	A timeline ripple (the moment they say something, and the ripple of others copying it).
	•	A score bar: productive vs destructive echo balance.
